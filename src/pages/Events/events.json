        "title": "What is climate change? A really simple guide", 
        "content": "World temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life. \nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species.\nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nWhat is climate change?Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions. The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport.\nWhen these fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.\nThe world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.\nWhat is the impact of climate change?\nExtreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods.\nWith further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nPeople in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.\nOur oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.\nWildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather.\nAnd as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening climate change.\nIn a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.\nScientists believe at least 550 species could be lost this century if action is not taken.\nWorld temperatures are rising because of human activity, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life. \nLeft unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species.\nWe face a huge challenge, but there are potential solutions.\nWhat is climate change?Climate is the average weather in a place over many years.

        "content": "Human activities are damaging and degrading the lands of the Earth in an unsustainable fashion according to a new UN report.\nUp to 40% of the global terrain has already been devalued, mainly through modern agriculture.\nIf nothing changes, then an additional area of land the size of South America will be damaged by 2050.\nBut if lands are restored and protected, they could help contain climate change and species loss.\nClimate change and farming driving insect decline\nAttenborough named 'Champion of the Earth' by UN\nKey UN climate finding widely misinterpreted\nThis second edition of the Global Land Outlook has been five years in the making, and it examines how the world is managing land resources such as soil, water and biodiversity.\nA major focus is the degradation of the lands of the Earth. This means the actions that are causing the land's overall health to decline, become less fertile, store less carbon and be able to support fewer species.\nThe report outlines the damage that's already been done but also offers hope that improvements in how we manage the land environment can offer a better future.\nRight now, around half the world's population is affected by the degradation of our lands",

        "content": "Countries have set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.\nThey hope to achieve the target of net zero by 2050, to help slow global warming.\nWhat does 'net zero' mean?\nNet zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nAchieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.\nGreenhouse gases like carbon dioxide CO2 are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.\nMeanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.\nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises well below 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",

        "content": "Dr Jurgenne Primavera is being paddled in a canoe along the coast of Iloilo in the Philippines. It's an idyllic scene but she is frowning. Six years ago these shallow waters were planted with mangroves as part of the country's ambitious National Greening Programme, but now there is nothing to see but blue water and blue sky.\nNinety per cent of the seedlings died, Dr Primavera says, because the type of mangrove planted was suited to muddy creeks rather than this sandy coastal area. The government preferred it, she suggests, because it is readily available and easy to pant.\nScience was sacrificed for convenience in the planting.\nThe National Greening Programme was an attempt to grow 1.5 million hectares of forest and mangroves between 2011 and 2019 but a withering report from the country's Commission on Audit found that in the first five years 88% of it had failed.",
