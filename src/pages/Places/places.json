        "title": "Australia lifts ban on former UK residents giving blood", 
        "content": "For two decades anyone who lived in the UK during its mad cow disease crisis has been barred from donating.\nIn rare cases, the fatal illness has been spread through blood transfusions.\nBut citing a review of epidemiological data and expert advice, Australia's health regulator said the cohort would no longer be excluded.\nPeople who lived in the UK between 1980 and 1996 will soon be able to roll up their sleeves to give blood or plasma.\nBovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is estimated to affected 180,000 cattle during the outbreak. Its human form - vCJD - has been attributed to 178 deaths.\nIt's thought that one in 2,000 people in the UK is a carrier of the disease. But it appears that relatively few who catch the infectious agent that causes the disease then go on to develop symptoms.\nAustralia's blood donation service, called Lifeblood, hopes the long-awaited move will unlock new donors at a time when high demand is straining stocks.\nIt's the number one query that we've had for change in Australia over the last few years and certainly, anecdotally, lots and lots of people are telling us that this change will enable them to donate, \nexecutive director Cath Stone said.\nWe are optimistic that we'll see tens of thousands of new people.\nLifeblood is working to update their screening processes to accommodate the change, but those who want to donate will be able to by the end of the year.\nWith a weekly need for 33,000 donations, the organisation is hoping barriers to donation for men who have sex with men will also soon be removed.\nAustralia was not alone in banning donations from former UK residents - others included France, the US and Canada.\nBut other countries have begun to lift or relax the restrictions, after Ireland lifted its ban in 2019.",

        "title": "Why British royals face simmering resentment in Caribbean", 
        "content": "People here pride themselves on the welcome offered to visitors - tourism is the country's mainstay after all. But behind the red carpet and guard of honour upon arrival, the royal couple's trip was met with pervasive apathy mixed with simmering resentment.\nIt was not always this way. Decades ago, the royals were greeted like deities, says local historian Ivor Ford.\nWe would all turn out to see them and wave flags. I suppose we didn't know better then, he muses.\nAntigua and Barbuda marked 40 years of independence from Britain last year. Today the nation - like its regional counterparts - retains a complicated relationship with its former colonial master.\nIncreasing awareness of the Caribbean's history and growing calls for financial reparations for slavery, coupled with a rise in pan-Africanism, are among the reasons cited for the shift in sentiment.\nBarbados' removal of Queen Elizabeth II as head of state last November spurred calls across the region for more islands to follow suit.\nBusinesswoman Makeda Mikael attended none of Monday's festivities, in contrast to her childhood when she says youngsters had no choice but to do so.\nWe didn't know as much about our history then as we do now, she tells the BBC. In school I wasn't taught African or Caribbean history. I knew everything about British and European history and nothing about ours.\nMs Mikael is a staunch advocate for reparations.\nEngland has enjoyed the benefit of our slave labour right up to today and they need to be honest, admit it and find a way to reconcile, she says.\nAs for the Queen, the majority of people couldn't care less if she's head of state or not, she adds. The Queen is not a significant part of anybody's agenda.",

        "title": "Venice's 'unbreakable' women of glass", 
        "content": "The sound of techno-punk confirmed I was in the right place. In their instructions on how to reach El Cocal Glass Studio, co-owners Chiara Lee Taiarol and Mariana Oliboni had said to follow the music as I made my way down a dusty alley and into an industrial complex off the touristy streets of Murano, the tiny island in the Venetian lagoon known globally for its glassmaking craft. You'll hear us, they had told me over the phone.\nStepping inside their workshop, which was lit up by disco lights, the music was even louder. Three women – Taiarol, Oliboni and Natalie Nikolova, a recent addition to the team – were moving swiftly around the space as if in sync with the beat, taking turn to place a long ferro sbuso (a metal blowpipe used to gather molten glass and begin the shaping process) into a red-hot, 1,200C refractory stone oven. Their working rhythm was deliberate, their movements almost choreographic. \nThe music powers us up, Oliboni said, as she saw me and went to turn the volume down. We do things a little differently from other studios, but we like it this way.\nThe techno-punk is only a part of it. El Cocal is Murano's first female-owned glass furnace. Different is the watchword for its entire essence – though you could say revolutionary, too.\nFor much of its 700 years' history – the Republic of Venice moved all glass furnaces and their artisans here in the late 1200s to contain the risk of fires in the city and, some say, protect the techniques behind the art – Murano's glassmaking sector has been notoriously male-dominated, often by families that have been in the business for generations. Sons, not daughters, would inherit the furnace and its trade secrets, beginning training as young as nine to master the craft of Venetian-style glass (the official descriptor for glass manufactured on the island).\nWhile you would find them doing lampwork (a type of glasswork in which a torch or lamp is used to melt the glass) decorating glass objects or serving as impiraresse (bead-stringers) for jewellery-making, women were nowhere to be seen in the workshops themselves, said Rosa Barovier Mentasti, a historian specialising in the history of Venetian glass. Molten glass can be extremely heavy to handle, so glassblowing was considered to be too much of a physical discipline for them to do.\nAlexis Silk, an American artist and trained glassmaker who's been working in Murano since 2012, also seeks to challenge the industry's modus operandi. Murano is a place steeped in tradition, she said. That's exactly what makes it so unique, and its glasswork so special. But it's also its biggest drawback. It's hard to look at the future and welcome changes when you're so anchored in the past. Through my presence here, I hope to foster the advancement of this art and show that a woman is as capable of working glass as any man.\nSilk makes monumental figurative pieces of female bodies that explore themes such as objectification and societal perceptions, sculpting them entirely freehand. They can weigh up to 32kg and stand up to 2m tall. In the glassmaking world, there are very few people who work on such a large scale – and that goes for all genders.\nTo help her handle the glass, Silk works with eight to nine glassmakers – all men – at Ars Murano glass factory, one of the island's most internationally renowned workshops. But, between episodes of sexism and pushback, it took her a while to find a team she could trust.\nThere generally is a reluctance towards letting women in, she said. It wasn't until Ars Murano that I felt at home as a glassmaker. Here, they respect me. There's a complete lack of ego.",
