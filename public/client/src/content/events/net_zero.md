# What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing?

## Countries have set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.

They hope to achieve the target of "net zero" by 2050, to help slow global warming.

## What does 'net zero' mean?
Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Achieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.

Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.

Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises "well below" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

## Will net zero mean a complete end to CO2 emissions?
Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain have to be compensated for, or offset - for example, by planting more trees.

Almost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of reducing carbon, although there may not be enough space for the number required.

Carbon capture and storage has also been suggested as another solution.

This involves using machinery to remove carbon from the air, then solidifying it and burying it underground.

However, the technology is still emerging, very expensive and as yet unproven.

## What will net zero mean for individuals?
It won't be easy.

Reaching net zero will involve moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our power, and abandoning vehicles run on petrol and diesel, in favour of those powered by electricity and hydrogen.

Gas central heating will need to be replaced by alternative sources, such as heat pumps.

Reaching net zero could also mean flying far less in future, and eating less red meat.
