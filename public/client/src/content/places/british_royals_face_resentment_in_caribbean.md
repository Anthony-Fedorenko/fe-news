# Why British royals face simmering resentment in Caribbean

## National flags still adorn the streets of Antigua's capital days after the Earl and Countess of Wessex departed the island on their Platinum Jubilee Caribbean tour.

People here pride themselves on the welcome offered to visitors - tourism is the country's mainstay after all. But behind the red carpet and guard of honour upon arrival, the royal couple's trip was met with pervasive apathy mixed with simmering resentment.

It was not always this way. Decades ago, the royals were greeted like "deities", says local historian Ivor Ford.

"We would all turn out to see them and wave flags. I suppose we didn't know better then," he muses.

Antigua and Barbuda marked 40 years of independence from Britain last year. Today the nation - like its regional counterparts - retains a complicated relationship with its former colonial master.

Increasing awareness of the Caribbean's history and growing calls for financial reparations for slavery, coupled with a rise in pan-Africanism, are among the reasons cited for the shift in sentiment.

Barbados' removal of Queen Elizabeth II as head of state last November spurred calls across the region for more islands to follow suit.
________________________________________________________Anti-royal sentiment in Antigua was more muted than in St Vincent where few can have failed to notice the juxtaposition of the red carpet welcome with the placard-bearing protesters that greeted the Wessexes when they touched down last Saturday.

"Generally people say they're tired of having the Queen as head of state. We're an independent country and there's no real benefit anymore," says radio station owner Douglas Defreitas.

"It's not like before when we could go to England without a visa; now there are restrictions. The call for reparations is in the air and that's the catalyst being used to propel the Queen's removal."

In October St Vincent will mark 43 years of independence.

"Years ago, royal arrivals were very robotic in the sense that we were told to line the streets and wave flags; we were taught to be a particular way," Mr Defreitas says, adding: "I believe it's time for us to become a republic; we should have our own autonomy."

"I think most Antiguans would want to replace the Queen now," Mr Ford continues. "Young people can't relate to the Royal Family; they don't understand their purpose. Even older people like me, I would love to see us become a republic. The head of state should be someone who is elected like in America."

The country's prime minister, Gaston Browne, alluded to long-term plans for such a move during a meeting with Prince Edward and Sophie on Monday - shortly before requesting the couple use their influence to facilitate "constructive talks" on reparatory justice for slavery.

Days earlier, the chair of the country's Reparations Support Commission, Dorbrene O'Marde, had issued an open letter to the Wessexes demanding compensation for enduring "injury, injustice and racism", adding that the royals continue to live in "splendour, pomp and wealth attained through the proceeds of the crimes".

## 'Couldn't care less'
Businesswoman Makeda Mikael attended none of Monday's festivities, in contrast to her childhood when she says youngsters "had no choice" but to do so.

"We didn't know as much about our history then as we do now," she tells the BBC. "In school I wasn't taught African or Caribbean history. I knew everything about British and European history and nothing about ours."

Ms Mikael is a staunch advocate for reparations.

"England has enjoyed the benefit of our slave labour right up to today and they need to be honest, admit it and find a way to reconcile," she says.

As for the Queen, "the majority of people couldn't care less if she's head of state or not", she adds. "The Queen is not a significant part of anybody's agenda."
