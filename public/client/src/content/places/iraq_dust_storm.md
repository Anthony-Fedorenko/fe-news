# Iraq dust storm: Flights grounded in Baghdad and Najaf as skies turn orange

## A thick cloud of orange dust has turned the skies over Iraq orange, as a major dust storm hit large parts of the country.

Flights have been grounded at airports in Baghdad and Najaf airports due to poor visibility.

The conditions are expected to continue into Monday, forecasters said.

Dust storms have become increasingly common in the Middle East, with experts blaming a combination of climate change and mismanagement of land and water.

In some places in Iraq on Saturday, visibility was limited to less than 500 metres.

Iraq experienced a series of dust storms last month, with dozens needing hospital treatment for respiratory problems.

Iraq's meteorological office previously told AFP the country is likely to see more and more dust storms due to drought, desertification and declining rainfall. A lack of green areas in and around cities can also contribute to the problem.

In 2016, The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) predicted that Iraq could witness 300 dust events in a year by 2026.
